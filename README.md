# Python Arcade Games

Hello, playing arcade games has been a hobby for me since childhood. Nowadays, I always find myself coming back to emulator to play old Game Boy games instead of the advanced graphics stuff.

In this repository, I will adventure in the game developing space. Why not do it in python, which is my go-to language for many other projects?

Among lots of options of game engines I choose Python Arcade and here is why:
1. It seems to be beginner friendly
2. It relies heavily on OOP, and I would like to learn more about python OOP
3. It comes with cool assets (soudns and sprites) to get started with
4. It is capable to support OpenGL and GPUs.. which I'm interested in

Thoughout the repository I will try many tutorials to get my hands dirty. While doing so, I hope to add my own personal taste to it. Let's see!
